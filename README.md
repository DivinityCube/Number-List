# Number List
A Number List program made in TKinter.

Outside of the application, versions are referred to by the first 3 numbers (e.g. 0.00, 0.01, etc.), however inside the application version numbers have an extra 3 numbers separated by a period (e.g. 0.00.182, 0.01.679, etc.).*

*These 3 extra numbers will be deprecated soon.
